# Instagram BOT

To do this, I used the following repository : [instagrapi](https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi)

The goal of this project is to post earthquakes photos captured with **MapBox** on Instagram with the details like location, magnitude, depth, etc. 

This is a personal project and it's coded with our configuration. 

**There are non commercial purposes.**

    python bot.py


## Config file

The config file should be changed before to run the script.

The data comes from the site [depremneredeoldu.com](https://depremneredeoldu.com) which use itself the data of **Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute**.
